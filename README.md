# Multiple Talking Platform with Rooms

I tried to create a Multiple talking website with rooms

You mustn't run to start "npm start", it doesn't work
Platform works with node(server.js), I rooted localhost:8080 to react build files. 

START with write on terminal `node server.js` ****
then it will type "Sunucu 8080. port'ta çalışıyor..." as in Turkish

Sorry some texts are Turkish, but you can understand.

Then you can see platform on your `localhost:8080` port
